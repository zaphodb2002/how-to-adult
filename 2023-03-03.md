## Things I Did
- 12:15 took 1/2 tbsp cannabutter (~100 mg THC) with lunch
	- 14:34 edible peak for sure
		- not crazy or anything, a medium dose I think.  Definitely felt pretty intoxicated there.  I'd argue too high for non-creative work.
	- 15:14 yup feeling less high now.  Still high but not that high
	- 16:00 pretty much sober now.  Still a little cotton-mouthy
