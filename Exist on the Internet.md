# Summary
## Campaign: [Financial Stability](Financial%20Stability.md)

## Complete Criteria:
1. Portfolio website is publicly available and presentable to potential employers
2. Have at least a year history of well populated Github activities.
3. Publish at least one open source project that gets 10 stars
4. 

## Why is this important?:
Better than a resume, a history of work that can be seen by anyone is extremely helpful in getting hired, I think.  Best way to show my work abilities is to show my work as much as possible.
