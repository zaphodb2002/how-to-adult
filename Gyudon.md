#### For the Sauce

-   ▢½ cup [dashi (Japanese soup stock; click to learn more)](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-make-dashi-jiru/) (for vegan/vegetarian, make [Vegan Dashi](https://www.justonecookbook.com/vegan-shiitake-kombu-dashi/))

#### For Serving

-   ▢2 servings cooked Japanese short-grain rice (1½ rice cooker cups (180 ml x 1.5 = 270 ml) yields roughly 2 servings (3 US cups) for donburi; see how to cook short-grain rice with a [rice cooker](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-make-rice/), a [pot over the stove](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-cook-rice/), an [Instant Pot](https://www.justonecookbook.com/instant-pot-rice/), or a [donabe](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-cook-rice-in-donabe/))
-   ▢[pickled red ginger (beni shoga or kizami beni shoga)](https://www.justonecookbook.com/pickled-red-ginger/) (to garnish)

### INSTRUCTIONS

 
-   Gather all the ingredients. I usually put the thinly sliced beef in the freezer for 10 minutes because it's a lot easier to cut semi-frozen meat.
    
-   First, thinly slice the onion.
    
-   Next, cut the green onions diagonally into thin slices.
    
-   Then, take out the meat from the freezer. Cut the sliced meat into pieces 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide.
    
-   In a large frying pan (do not turn on the heat yet), add the dashi, sake, mirin, soy sauce, and sugar. Mix to combine.
    
-   Next, add the onion slices and spread them throughout the pan, separating the onion layers.
    
-   Then, add the meat on top of the onions. Separate the thin slices of beef so the meat covers the onions.
    
-   Cover the pan with a lid and start cooking over medium heat.
    
-   When the meat is cooked, [skim off the scum and fat](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-skim-off-the-scum-and-fat-from-soups-and-stocks/) from the broth with a fine-mesh skimmer. Turn down the heat to simmer and continue cooking, covered, for 3-4 minutes.
    
-   Sprinkle the green onions on top and cook covered for another minute. If you like to add beaten eggs, you can add at this step (or refer to my [Tanindon](https://www.justonecookbook.com/tanindon/) recipe).
    
-   In a large donburi bowl, add the steamed rice and drizzle the remaining sauce on top.
    
-   Put the beef and onion mixture on top. If you’d like, drizzle the remaining sauce on top. Top with the pickled red ginger. Enjoy!
    

#### To Store

-   You can keep any leftover beef and egg mixture in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 days, and in the freezer for up to 3-4 weeks
