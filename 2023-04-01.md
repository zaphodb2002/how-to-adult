It's my birthday!
Steph and I went hiking in Daley Ranch which was super full of water.  Running streams we had to cross on planks.  Was a lot of fun.

We also went to the mall and to Barnes and Noble.  I got a book about San Diego County Plants and a bunch of magic cards at Comics N Stuff.  Tired, but a nice day.

Oh also I had a totally bomb Korean Fusion Spicy Chicken sandwich from K-Bop in the mall.  Good as hell.
