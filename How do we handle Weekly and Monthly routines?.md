# Notes
The idea here is that some tasks need to be populated at the beginning of the week (Mon), and due at the end of the week (Sun).

I think we're just going to shove everything into the Daily note.  We should treat routine tasks like we treat any task.  this serves [ Design Pillar](00%20-%20Life%20Management%20System.md#Design%20Pillars%20) #2.  They are tasks, treat them like tasks.
