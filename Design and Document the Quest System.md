# Things to Do
- [ ] New Quest: Think more about how to link daily, weekly, and monthly notes in missions and quests 🥄1 ⏫ ➕ 2023-04-06
	- My perception of time is bad, a hallmark of ADHD.  This could help with that.
	- Monthly and weekly notes are supposed to show zoomed out perspective.  However, dataviews don't make links.  Need some hard links in there.
- [ ] Create the first mission for this quest 🥄1 ➕ 2023-03-31
- [ ] When you're not sure what to produce for a quest (remember quests NEED a product) 
	- Levels of depth and complexity
		- Essay (familiarity)
		- Paper (deep understanding)
		- Book (mastery)
- [ ] how are quests and missions linked together? ➕ 2023-03-10
