# Notes
The concept of achievements is for things that are either optional goals or milestones.
Examples:
	- Bureaucrat (Sort x number of tasks into Missions)

	- Completed a routine every day for a (week/month/season/year)
	- Completed the (first/10th/100th) mission
	- Complete the (first/10th/100th) quest

- Criteria to complete. (I'm pretty sure there's a progress bar plugin)
- Maybe levels (bronze, silver, gold)
- REALLY could be driven by the community.  People sharing achievements could be great
