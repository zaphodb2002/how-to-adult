## Things that Happened
Feeling kinda crap today. [Depression](Depression.md) coming on, I think.  If so, this is the first down part in the cycle since I started the LMS, at this point about a month and a half ago.  It's good to track that stuff.  I've had a few intrusive thoughts about Andy's death lately, not sure why they're cropping up again.  I've been able to handle it okay so far but it's not very pleasant.  I've also been more [Cranky](Cranky.md) the last few days, easier to [Anger](Anger.md) over dumb stuff.  The system will get tested as I go into the down side.  This is the point of the thing, to keep me going when I'm down.  

In general, I need to slow down.  I think if I can even out my pace I won't have such big emotional shifts.  I am actually [Proud](Proud.md) of myself for resisting the urge to buy a bunch of extra seeds and shit at Walter Anderson's.  I did buy that [Raspberry](./Raspberry.md), which needs to be addressed in the quest.  I'll go make an item for that now.

I really should just write in here more.  Putting words down on paper is both therapeutic and helps to get my thoughts more organized.  Plus later I can come back and link things.
