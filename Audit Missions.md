# Audit Worksheet
## Q: Is this working well?
### A:  
- Yes, for the most part.  The general idea is working well and we're tracking projects.  However, the lines between a minor quest and a mission are still a little blurry and there's a lot of manual work to close missions
### Q: If yes, is there anything that can be improved?
#### A:
- [Missions should cross themselves off when they're completed or failed](./Missions%20should%20cross%20themselves%20off%20when%20they're%20completed%20or%20failed.md)
> Make a quest for it
### Q: If no, what's not working?
#### A:

##### Q: How can we solve the issue?
###### A: 

## Q: Is this taking a lot of your time?
### A:
-  No, this is not a time sink
### Q: If yes, can it be automated?
#### A: 
> If yes, go make a quest
###### Q: If no, is there some other way to cut down on the time?
A: 
> If yes, go make a quest. If no, I guess consider a total rework or scrapping it
