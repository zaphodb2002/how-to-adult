# Summary
## Quest: [Expand Workflow Documentation](./Expand%20Workflow%20Documentation.md)
# Tasks
- [x] Create [Tasks](./Tasks.md) ✅ 2023-04-04
- [ ] Should it be a rule that when a "New X" quest is created, it automatically is set due? ➕ 2023-03-31
	- The idea here is that these are really just placeholder tasks and they require fleshing out the quest or mission or whatever to actually move forward	
	- Also probably need a rule that these cannot be completed until all the required fields on the New X are filled out
 - [x] add to workflow: active quests and missions must have scheduled or due dates for all tasks ⏫ ➕ 2023-03-31 ⏳ 2023-04-03 ✅ 2023-04-04
 - [x] Add to Workflow: Make sure quest and mission tasks that are not active do NOT have a date ➕ 2023-03-31 ⏳ 2023-04-03 ✅ 2023-04-04
- [x] Create the first task for this mission ⏫ ➕ 2023-04-04 ⏳ 2023-04-04 ✅ 2023-04-04
