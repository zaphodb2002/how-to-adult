## Complete Criteria:
1.  

## Why is this important?:
You need to be able to find your shit when you need it, and you need to take better care of your shit.  Environment matters.  Get baskets and shelves and hooks.  Put things away where they go.  It will help, I promise.

# Notes
[My House](./My%20House.md)

On Struggle Care, she talks about breaking cleaning tasks into 3 distinct groups:
- Tidying: Putting things where they go
- Organizing: Finding places for things or optimizing said places
- Cleaning: Removing dirt and grime

This makes sense to me and is a good framework to think about incorporating in general.
