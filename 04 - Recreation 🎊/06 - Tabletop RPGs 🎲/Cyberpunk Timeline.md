Silicon Valley is in control, brings rise to Technocrat Party, also powerful in Cascadia.
San Francisco is the heart of Technocrat culture in the west. Very anti-Ultra-Nationalist, but also a strong-subculture of Punk from up north, lots of conflict between the two.
Los Angeles is mostly Technocrat, but some Punk.
Inland Empire is Technocrat with some Ultra-Nationalist support further east. Very little Punk.
San Diego is Technocrat with a strong military influence. As with everywhere in California, Ultra-Nationalist support rises as you go east, but San Diego has a few VERY strong pockets of Ultra-Nationalist support, particularly East County and Fallbrook. Some Punk.

Imperial County is mostly a wasteland, with the exception of Palm Springs, which continues as a resort town for the wealthy. Owned by a private corp now.
