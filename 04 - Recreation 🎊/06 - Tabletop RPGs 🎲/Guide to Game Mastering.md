# The Flow
1. Scene Setting Narration ("You're in a cave. There's a dragon.")
2. Inviting the Principle Player to Play ("PlayerName, What does your CharacterName do?")
3. Declare - Determine - Describe
	1. Player DECLARES the action
		1. Rule #1 - Action must Be Complete. What are they trying to accomplish and how, as well as anything relevant. Don't let them get away with adding things after the fact.
		2. Rule #2 - Action must Be Concise. No flowery prose, and definitely no describing the outcome. Must be intent to attempt.
		3. Rule #3 - Don't cite rules. Players cannot be allowed to declare actions in Game Mechanical terms.
			- Bad: "My character makes an Athletics Check".
			- Good: "My character attempts to climb the wall."
		4. GM must tell players if what they want to do is impossible or absurdly dangerous. They can do it anyway, but let them know.
		5. Confirm the action by repeating it back to the player.
	1. GM DETERMINES the outcome
	2. GM DESCRIBES the result
		- Don't skip this step. It's the most important one.

# The Skills
## Narration
- Clear and concise, not flowery prose
- The more consistent you are, the better the players can understand the consequences of their actions
- Lifestyle Changes (start with every day for 2 weeks)
	- Reduce sensory noise (stop listening to so many podcasts, learn to handle the silence).
	- 15 minutes a day of boredom. Eyes open, sitting up.
	- Read a real book with your eyeballs 30 minutes a day. Like strength training for visualization.

### Scene Setting

- Construct the scene before describing. Clarity and consistency will come from having a solid idea.
- Use sensory descriptions. See, yes, but also hear, smell, feel, and taste
- Breathe, then Speak. Every time. Stop, close your eyes, and take a moment to think before beginning narration.
- Repetition is good. The players don't hear as much as they think they do. Details, phrases, descriptive elements
#### Exercise 1: Say what you saw (15 minutes 3x a week)
1. Limit sensory noise
2. Acquire Art
3. Sit with said Art for a while. Really explore it.
4. Put the Art away.
5. Describe the Art as best as you can, out loud, until you can't remember anything else.
6. Get Art out again and study again, then put away and repeat.
#### Exercise 2: Free Description Journaling (15 minutes 3x a week)
1. Acquire random location prompts (D100 or whatever)
2. Write for 15 minutes, describing the location. No edits, no stopping. Just describe, nothing else.
#### Exercise 3: Build a Sensory Sanctuary and Visit Every Day
Also great for destressing

First Run:
1. Construct a relaxing scene. This will be your Sensory Sanctuary, so make it nice.
2. Close your eyes.
3. Describe as many visual details as possible
4. Describe as many auditory details as possible
5. Describe as many smell details as possible
6. Describe as many touch details as possible
7. Open your eyes. Take a breath.
8. Close your eyes and see if the scene is still there.
9. Write down what your remember.

Every day after:
1. Close your eyes
2. Construct the scene again as best as you can.
3. Explore the scene in your mind for 10 minutes. Give it your full attention.
4. Open your eyes. Take a breath.
5. Close your eyes, and see if the scene's still there.
6. If there are new details, add them to your record of this scene.

# Interacting with Players
 - Players will be more happy with their characters in the long run if you are firm about not allowing respecs or do-overs
 - Limitations breed creativity. Don't be afraid to place restrictions.
 - "PlayerName, What does your CharacterName do?"
	- use this format every damn time, for everything. This is how we talk to players.
	- Get's player's attention and helps to link character names to people
	- "PlayerName, CharacterName takes 10 damage."
	- Speak TO players and ABOUT characters
	- again, consistency is key for pacing
- Demand your players' attention. Humiliate distracted players.
		- if they're not ready for their turn immediately, "okay I'll come back to you, you're Holding your turn until then." If they lose their turn, oh well.
- ShortDesc: To replace a character name (or worse, "this one") with a short description of said character. Helps to reinforce visualization in players.
	- These can be populated at NPC creation, make a few, helps to give them descriptions and differentiation
- Always address one character specifically, not the group as a whole
- The Principal Character: every interaction should spotlight an individual player.
	- in combat, determined by initiative
	- out of combat, character in best position to act given the situation
	- They start the conversation or if under duress make the check
	- If player stumbles, catch the Egg and hand it to another player


# Making NPCs into Characters
- Accents and Impressions
- Consistency, both individually and across groups
-
