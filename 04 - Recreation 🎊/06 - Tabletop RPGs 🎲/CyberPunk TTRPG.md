# Summary

[Cyberpunk Timeline](./Cyberpunk%20Timeline.md)
[Cyberpunk Gear](./Cyberpunk%20Gear.md)

# Palette
- Corporations rule in all but name, politics is mostly for rich centrists and religious weirdos. Punks are anti-corp and the Ultra-Nationalists are just fascists.
- Everything that isn't a major city or major protected space is corporate owned, and therefore pretty much ignored by government entities. Private police force, private laws. Some are worse than others.
- Return of Company Towns and Scrip
- Highways are technically federal, making them effectively ungoverned, like international waters
- Unions unprotected by government, brutally put down by Corpo mercs
- Corporations war with each other over resources
- Military Level Tech is rare and expensive
- But Consumer Level Tech is pretty damn good, if monstrously expensive and invasive
- Maker Level Tech is highly dependent on the skill of the Maker. 
- Corporate Firmware works well but has protections, spyware, and backdoors, FOSS firmware does not but has technical issues and sometimes just gets abandoned
- WW3 Starts 2026 (just like in Star Trek)
- AI didn't really gain sentience, so much as become a tool used by capitalists to widen the wealth gap and reinforce societal norms through propaganda
- Different Corp's AI algos have a specific personality
- Gang called the Desert Rats, work for local corp in desert
- Local Corps run like local mobs, more sophisticated as you get up the chain, super cutthroat

# Scenes


## Opening
For this first scene, it might be useful to restrict the players to only statistics rolls, and not delve too far into specific skills.
### Setting
Players start in the back of a box van, bound and unconscious. Dark in the box, but few pinpricks of searing white light. It is the 4 of them, dehydrated and overheated, plus two others, one Tommy 'TuPac' Paclibar, the other the corpse of a woman in her mid 40s, who died from the blows all of them were dealt when they were kidnapped last night. The box van is locked from the outside by a latch, no lock, but no way to access from inside.

Surrounding the box van are littered the bodies of men who killed each other in a gunfight. No survivors are to be found. Some (somewhat low quality) guns and ammo, though. And the gear you had last night. Plus some Fud sticks and water, enough for a couple of days, in another box truck. This truck does not run, but the one they were tied up in does. It has low charge, however, maybe another 10-20 miles, less if uphill.

Surrounding this gruesome scene is a road through a rocky canyon in the Anza Borrego Desert. Specifically, they're on Box Canyon Rd, just outside Mecca, CA. The year is 2045.

#### Prompts
"Who's the first one to start regaining consciousness?" Roll WILL or BODY, whoever gets highest goes first.

"Your head is pounding. Did you get hit, drugged, just hungover? What does your character think happened? Is this scary or just the usual for you?" Use this to prompt the players to talk about their character a bit.

Go around to each player and ask them the same thing.

Remaining characters roll again for regaining consciousness. Highest is addressed next.

"You haven't opened your eyes yet. You struggle to lift the lids and get things into focus. Brain's coming out of a fog. You're somewhere dark, and hot. The floor below your cheek is metal and filthy. It smells bad, like shit and vomit and sweat. You hope that's not you. Any ideas yet?"

Players can use Skills to work their way out of the blurriness and discover where they are. 
Examples:
- BODY to shrug off the stupor
- WILL to master yourself and focus
- INT for deduction or perception
- TECH to know something about your prison

"As your vision adjusts and your brain fog lifts, you see scuff marks on the floor beside your head. They look old and worn."

"It's dark, yes, but not completely. There are shafts of light leaking in from outside. You're in a metal box, maybe 10x6x6."

"The light is leaking in from between the slats of a segmented roll-up door at what is presumably the back of this box van."

"You're not alone. There are 5 other people. Other players, what does he/she see?"

They can see each other as they come to, use that to describe the characters.

"The first of the other two people is a slightly chubby 31 year old Asian or Pacific Islander man. He's dressed very functionally, but business casual. Dark blue slacks with reinforced knees and a million pockets, a grey polo shirt with a id badge clipped to it. It was obviously clean before some scuffle, now covered in red dirt and some blood splatter from his swollen face. His breathing is ragged, but he is breathing."

"The other is a latina woman, mid 40s. She's wearing a light dress and house slippers. She's lying on her back in a pool of blood, her eyes open and staring up at the roof of the box."

"The badge reads 'Tommy Paclibar: TL4' and has a picture of Tommy smiling like an idiot. He's wearing glasses in this picture, but not currently."

Tommy wakes up.

"What were you doing out here in the desert last night?" Use this question to let the players build locations or entities into the world. Possibilities:
- At a bar
- Working a legit job
- Working a "legit" job (i.e. crime)
- Street or offroad racing (Lots of Desert Rats) or general hooliganism
- Visiting a friend here
- Was on a long drive, stopped at a gas station or rest stop




### What really did happen?
Bad luck, mostly. Local enforcers from a local corp out gathering people to sell into corporate slavery. They needed 6 people, they didn't ask why. Not that any of these idiots could tell them that now. The supply truck broke a trailing arm after hitting a particularly bad pothole, and they all argued until it turned into gunfire, and not a single one survived.
