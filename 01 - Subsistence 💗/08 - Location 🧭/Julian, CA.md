USDA Plant Hardiness Zone: 
7 (according to Sally Snipes)




- [2023-04-04](../../00%20-%20Life%20Management%20System/09%20-%20Daily%20Notes/2023-04-04.md) I attended a presentation at the Library where Sally Snipes, local master gardener, was the speaker. I recorded the talk on my phone. The biggest takeaway, though, is that she uses USDA Zone 7, which would imply temps between 0 and 10 F, which is way colder than I think it gets here. That said, she's been doing this for longer than I've been alive so I'll shut up and listen to the expert.
