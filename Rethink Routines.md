# Things to Do




# Summary
campaign:: [00 - Life Management System](./00%20-%20Life%20Management%20System.md)
aspect:: [03 - Workflow](./03%20-%20Workflow.md)
## Complete Criteria:
1. 

## Why is this important?:
Routines are the stuff that I have to do but don't wanna.  If we can make these as streamlined and efficient as possible, I will get things done more.

# Notes


- [Routines Feature Design](./Routines%20Feature%20Design.md)
- [Obsidian Tasks](./Obsidian%20Tasks.md) has issues
	    - clutters up the tool and makes it run like dog shit
	    - doesn't auto fail if after due date
	    - doesn't consider time of day
	    - blocks [Emoji Shortcodes](Emoji%20Shortcodes.md)
	    - ~~doesn't track the ➕ for create date~~ or prompt it
		    - 2023-03-24 16:25 ➕ implemented in 2.0, still waiting on prompt
	    - incomplete implementation of [Urgency](Urgency.md)
- Really think about how this should be structured and what we actually want it to do.  Make a design before just hauling off and implementing.
