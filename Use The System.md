# Things to Do
- [ ] Make goals for each campaign and topic ➕ 2023-03-01 
- [ ] Should I add the quest tracker to the Daily Note? 🥄0 ⏫ ➕ 2023-03-30
- [ ] Types of quests for consistency? 🥄1 ⏫ ➕ 2023-03-29
	- The idea here would be that different kinds of quests would have different templates and different costs.
	- Types:
		- Main Quests
		- Create a Thing Quests
		- Repeating Quests (Monthly, Seasonally, or Yearly)
	- Maybe also a difficulty and/or fun rating to give an idea of spoon cost
	- Templater can prompt the user for stuff before inserting the template
- [ ] Bonus Objectives? ➕2023-03-20
