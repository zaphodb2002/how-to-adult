# Things I've Done
- [x] New Quest: Consider moving away from Obsidian Tasks and making the Note, instead of the Task, the atomic unit. #bureaucracy 🥄+1 ⏫ ➕ 2023-04-04 ⏳ 2023-04-24 ✅ 2023-04-17
- [-] Need a way to flag quests or missions I'm actually interested in doing vs things I know I need to do but don't wanna ➕2023-04-11 ⏳ 2023-04-17
	-  2023-04-14 - Tags basically take care of this.  There's a tag for fun and NotFun.  Cancelling this task.
- [-] New Mission: How do I prompt for too many open tabs? #bureaucracy 🥄+1 ⏫ ➕ 2023-03-03 ⏳ 2023-04-17
	- the stacking tabs / sliding windows dealio helps a lot but it's not perfect.  I'd apparently work in a tiny sliver of a window than close anything, ever.
	- 2023-04-11 I don't think this is really a problem.  cancelling.
