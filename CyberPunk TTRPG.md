# Summary

[Cyberpunk Timeline](./Cyberpunk%20Timeline.md)

# Palette
- Corporations rule in all but name, politics is mostly for rich centrists and religious weirdos.  Punks are anti-corp and the Ultra-Nationalists are just fascists.
- Everything that isn't a major city or major protected space is corporate owned, and therefore pretty much ignored by government entities.  Private police force, private laws.  Some are worse than others.
- Return of Company Towns and Scrip
- Highways are technically federal, making them effectively ungoverned, like international waters
- Unions unprotected by government, brutally put down by Corpo mercs
- Corporations war with each other over resources
- Military Level Tech is rare and expensive
- But Consumer Level Tech is pretty damn good, if monstrously expensive and invasive
- Maker Level Tech is highly dependent on the skill of the Maker. 
- Corporate Firmware works well but has protections, spyware, and backdoors, FOSS firmware does not but has technical issues and sometimes just gets abandoned
- WW3 Starts 2026 (just like in Star Trek)
- AI didn't really gain sentience, so much as become a tool used by capitalists to widen the wealth gap and reinforce societal norms through propaganda
- Different Corp's AI algos have a specific personality
- Gang called the Desert Rats, work for local corp in desert
- Local Corps run like local mobs, more sophisticated as you get up the chain, super cutthroat

# Scenes
## Before the Campaign Begins
### [](.md)


## Opening

### Setting
Players start in the back of a box van, bound and unconscious.  Dark in the box, but few pinpricks of searing white light.  It is the 4 of them, dehydrated and overheated, plus two others, one Tommy 'TuPac' Paclibar, the other the corpse of a woman in her mid 40s, who died from the blows all of them were dealt when they were kidnapped last night.  The box van is locked from the outside by a latch, no lock, but no way to access from inside.

Surrounding the box van are littered the bodies of men who killed each other in a gunfight.  No survivors are to be found.  Some (somewhat low quality) guns and ammo, though.  And the gear you had last night.  Plus some Fud sticks and water, enough for a couple of days, in another box truck.  This truck does not run, but the one they were tied up in does. It has low charge, however, maybe another 10-20 miles, less if uphill.

Surrounding this gruesome scene is a road through a rocky canyon in the Anza Borrego Desert.  Specifically, they're on Box Canyon Rd, just outside Mecca, CA.  The year is 2045.

#### Prompts
"Who's the first one to start regaining consciousness?" Roll WILL or COOL or BODY

"Your head is pounding.  Did you get hit, drugged, just hungover?  What does your character think?" Use this to prompt the players to talk about their character a bit.

"You haven't opened your eyes yet.  You struggle to lift the lids and get things into focus.  Brain's coming out of a fog.  You're somewhere dark, and hot.  Any ideas yet?"

Players can use Skills to work their way out of the blurriness and discover where they are.

They can see each other as they come to and succeed on rolls, use that to describe the characters.

"What were you doing out here in the desert last night?" Use this question to let the players build locations or entities into the world.  Possibilities:
- At a bar
- Working a legit job
- Working a "legit" job (i.e. crime)
- Street or offroad racing (Lots of Desert Rats) or general hooliganism
- Visiting a friend here
- Was on a long drive, stopped at a gas station or rest stop

"How did you end up here, do you remember yet or do you want to keep investigating?" Flip this on the players, give them a chance to world-build. But they can say no, they want to wait for more info. Encourage them to help each other.

### What really did happen?
Bad luck, mostly.  Local enforcers from a local corp out gathering people to sell into corporate slavery.  They needed 6 people, they didn't ask why.  Not that any of these idiots could tell them that now.  The supply truck broke a trailing arm after hitting a particularly bad pothole, and they all argued until it turned into gunfire, and not a single one survived.
