## Journal Entry

20:57 - Went to [Temecula](Temecula.md) today with [Steph](./Stephanie%20Fear.md) and [Mom](./Tara%20Lindhardt.md) to have sushi with [Jon Hamilton](./Jon%20Hamilton.md) and [Aunt Robin](./Robin%20Hamilton.md).  Went to Sushi Boat in the Temecula mall.  It was pretty good, got the Unagi roll there.  Delightful.  Steph got Ramen which was pretty good too.  They had deep fried gyoza that I liked but Steph didn't.  To be fair to her the insides were a little overcooked. #japanese #socializing #sushi

I was feeling a bit [defensive](defensive.md) today.  Also maybe a bit [Cranky](Cranky.md).  Drive to Temecula is long.  Was delightfully green though.  Everything really blowing up.  The [Oak Scrubland](Oak%20Scrubland.md) stuff particularly interests me, I need to get on that book [San Diego County Native Plants](./San%20Diego%20County%20Native%20Plants%20-%20James%20Lightner.md).  Good for [01 - Cartooning](./01%20-%20Cartooning.md) and [03 - 3D Modeling](./03%20-%203D%20Modeling.md) practice too.  The colors today were very pretty.  Many shades of green with the occasional pop of yellow or blue.  The [Mountain Lilac](Mountain%20Lilac.md) especially is gorgeous.

Mom's also shopping for a car because hers crapped out.  We're looking at [Miata](Miata.md)s which is a lot of fun and also gets me to look at the market again which I haven't done in a bit.  There's stuff out there but the good examples are still like $15K.  I still think the import path is the best one.
