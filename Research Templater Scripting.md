# Summary
Basically a lot of this is just learning JavaScript, but let's get some knowledge notes to document this stuff.
# Tasks
- [ ] Create the first task for this mission #bureaucracy ü•Ñ+1 ‚è´ ‚ûï 2023-03-24

# Notes
- https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater/discussions/categories/help?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+category%3AHelp+sort%3Atop&page=3
	- TAKE FUCKING NOTES
		- Snippets are good
		- useful for improving [rolloverDailyTodos.js](./00%20-%20Life%20Management%20System/06%20-%20Scripts/rolloverDailyTodos.js.md)
		- suggester is a big one
		- turn off [Obsidian Tasks](./Obsidian%20Tasks.md)  and test doing task input with templater
		- Is this part of just a bigger quest to master Templater, or maybe JS and web stuff in general?
