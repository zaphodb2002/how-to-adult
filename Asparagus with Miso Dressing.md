source: https://www.justonecookbook.com/asparagus-with-miso-dressing/
## Ingredients
- 8 oz [Asparagus](./Asparagus.md) spears (12 pieces)
- 2 Tbsp [white miso](https://www.justonecookbook.com/miso/) (I used [Hikari Miso Organic White Miso](https://hikarimiso.com/product/organic-miso/organic-miso-white-17-6-oz-500g/))
-   1 Tbsp sugar
-   1 Tbsp [rice vinegar (unseasoned)](https://www.justonecookbook.com/rice-vinegar/)
- 1/8 tsp [Japanese karashi hot mustard](https://www.justonecookbook.com/pantry/karashi-mustard/)

## What is Karashi Sumisoae

**Sumisoae** (酢味噌和え) [su (vinegar)/miso/ae] is a dish that ingredient(s) is/are dressed with vinegar (_su_, 酢) and miso-based sauce. The sauce is typically made with miso, rice vinegar, sugar.

In this recipe, I added karashi ([Japanese hot mustard](https://www.justonecookbook.com/karashi-mustard/)), so we’ll be making **Karashi Sumisoae** (辛子酢味噌和え) today. You can leave out karashi, but it seriously adds a bold punch to the dish.

**Karashi** (辛子) is made of a mixture of crushed mustard seeds of _Brassica juncea_ and horseradish. Compared to mild yellow mustard, it’s a lot spicier and intense but also more complex, with a pleasant undertone sweetness. I always have this condiment in my pantry as a quick flavor booster.

**-ae** (和え) is a Japanese cooking style or a dish name that ingredients are dressed with some kind of sauce.

For example, when an ingredient is dressed with sesame seed-based sauce, it’s called goma-ae (胡麻和え) as goma means sesame seeds.

## Helpful Tips on Cooking Asparagus

### How to Select Best Asparagus

-   **Enjoy when it’s in season –** Asparagus is a **springtime produce** (between February and June) and that’s when it’s at its optimal freshness. Although it is available year-round here in California, spring is when domestic asparagus is in season. Its journey to us is shorter and the flavor is sweeter.
-   **Spear size –** You will see thick spears about the size of a marker and spears as thin as a pencil. Contrary to the old myths, neither thin or thick is superior in flavor. In general, and as expected, the thinner ones cook faster. For presentation and a minimal prep dish like this, I’d go with the thicker spears.
-   **Look at the tips and color** – The tip should be closed, intact, and dry (not mushy). The color should be in bright green.

### How to Store Asparagus for a Long Time

-   Trim off the bottoms and wrap in a damp paper towel before putting them in a plastic bag (it’s a good tip for the majority of vegetables).
-   Store the asparagus in the vegetable or crisper section of the refrigerator.
-   When the tips get mushy, it’s best to discard them.

### 5 Steps to Perfectly Blanched Asparagus

1.  Discard the inedible tough bottoms off asparagus. For this recipe, I wanted a clean look, so I cut off the bottoms with a knife (and continue cutting into 2-inch/5-cm pieces). You can also snap the bottoms off with your fingertips, or shave off the thick outer skin with a vegetable peeler.
2.  Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
3.  When boiling, add salt and cook asparagus stems for 1 to 1.5 minutes, then add the spears to cook another minute, or until crisp-tender. Depending on the thickness of the asparagus, the blanching time should be 2 to 2.5 minutes but adjust the cooking time based on the thickness of the asparagus. Do not overcook.
4.  Shock in an ice water bath to stop the cooking process, which brings out the beautiful green color.
5.  Drain well and ready to assemble.
