## Things to Do


## Things I Did
- Created [Set Up Obsidian](./Set%20Up%20Obsidian.md#) quest
- Created [Use The System](./Use%20The%20System.md#) quest
- Had an issue where I lost this note.  Not sure what happened but I was mucking about in the settings for [Quickadd](Quickadd.md).  Had to recreate.  This really needs to not happen.
- Took an [edible](./Cannabis%20Edibles.md#) at ~15:45 and it's 17:08 now.  1 tsp cannabutter (estimated 75mg) in coffee.  Haven't eaten much today but what I did eat was fatty.
- Rejiggering [Quest Tracker](./Quest%20Tracker.md) and [Campaigns](Campaigns.md) a bunch.  
	- The campaigns will hopefully grow organically, should really only make a new folder when I need it.
	- Quest Tracker needs a lot of work.  the big issue is formatting, I have all the data I need.  
- Set up [Obsidian Sync](Obsidian%20Sync.md) so I can use this thing on my phone.  $96 a year but I can cut some stuff to offset.
- Implemented a [Scratch Pad](./Scratch%20Pad.md) to use for code stuff like math and whatever
- got this dumb thing synced to my phone
