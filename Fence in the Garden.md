# Summary
quest:: [Dirt Farmer](./Dirt%20Farmer.md)
started:: [2023-W13](./2023-W13.md)
The dogs wreck up the place and need to be kept out.  Also I think psychologically sectioning off an area will help me tackle the task.

# Tasks
- [ ] Roughly level the work area. 🥄10 ⏫ ➕ 2023-03-25 ⏳ 2023-04-24

# Things I've Done
- [x] make a plan for the garden gates. ⏫ ➕ 2023-03-18 📅 2023-03-26 ✅ 2023-03-26
- [x] Measure hardware diameter on fence ⏫ ➕ 2023-03-26 📅 2023-03-27 ✅ 2023-03-27
- [x] Buy supplies for gates ⏫ ➕ 2023-03-12 📅 2023-03-27 ✅ 2023-03-27
	- 2023-03-25 12:47 Steph and Jon have a chain link gate they will give me.  Thanks!  changing list to reflect.
	- 2023-03-18 19:32 pushing this, need a more solid plan
	- Concrete
	- Post Hole Digger?
	- Gravel
	- Chain Link posts (2x, verify size)
- [x] Buy the supplies ➕ 2023-03-10 📅 2023-03-10 ✅ 2023-03-10
	- 2023-03-10 16:09 bought 20 t posts and 100ft of wire fencing, hopefully that's enough.  Was like $250 for all.  Jon has a post hole smasher doodle so I'll be able to use that.
- [x] Install the fence across the west side ⏫ ➕ 2023-03-10 ⏳ 2023-03-12 📅 2023-03-12 ✅ 2023-03-12
	- posts 8ft apart
	- attach to the fence in front of or behind the gate?
		- in front: easier, less materials required, allows for truck access, dogs could get out if it was left open (though that doesn't happen often)
		- behind: Can dump truck contents directing into garden area instead of needing to be hauled around, dogs can't get out if it's left open
		- I think in front, keeping the gate open to the forest and the garden a little smaller.  I don't think that gate will get left open, it's huge and obviously open when it is.  Garage will eventually solve this anyway.
	- How do we attach the fencing to the t posts?
		- Had to buy clips, $5 for 25 clips, bought 4
- [x] Acquire string ⏫ ➕ 2023-03-10 ⏳ 2023-03-11 📅 2023-03-11 ✅ 2023-03-11
	- will make laying out this thing way easier and more betterer.  Trust me. 
	- useful for keeping a straight line
	- useful for keeping the top level
- [x] Acquire snips good enough to cut this fencing ⏫ ➕ 2023-03-10 ⏳ 2023-03-11 📅 2023-03-11 ✅ 2023-03-11
	- Do I not have snips good enough for this just lying around?  Prove me wrong!  If you go out and you haven't looked yet, you need to just buy them.  Tools need a quest all to themselves.
	- just buy new ones.  Take care of them. [A Man's Only As Good As His Tools](./A%20Man's%20Only%20As%20Good%20As%20His%20Tools.md), after all.
