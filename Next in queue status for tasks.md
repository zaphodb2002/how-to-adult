# Summary
Need to be able to flag certain tasks as "next" so that the urgency is forced to next in line.  This will allow me to not necessarily interrupt what I'm currently doing but makes sure that when I'm done I don't forget to do that thing.  Probably has some crossover with [Implement Procrastination Mode](./Implement%20Procrastination%20Mode.md) since they're both about manipulating urgency.

# Tasks
- [ ] 2023-03-08 09:19 -  ðŸ”¼ Try to implement with current functionality.  Go through the docs of Tasks. âž• 2023-03-08 
	- The issue here is that urgency in [Obsidian Tasks](./Obsidian%20Tasks.md) is only calculated by start, schedule, and due dates, and of course priority. 
	- [ ] if this doesn't work, we can take a look at the code and see if we can submit a pr to add this kind of functionality.
