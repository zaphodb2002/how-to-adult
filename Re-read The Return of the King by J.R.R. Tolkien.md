# Notes
[The Return of the King - J R R Tolkien](./The%20Return%20of%20the%20King%20-%20J%20R%20R%20Tolkien.md)

The best part of this book is the denouement after the end of the war, especially The Scouring of the Shire.  I love seeing the changes in both the Shire while the Hobbits were away, and also how much they have changed themselves.  Also I love the community rallying they do.  Buncha badasses.
