Draw a circle
Put dots for eyes
put a line for the mouth
You've drawn a cartoon!

ears go inline with eyes
top of nose between eyes

Experiment with different head shapes
Experiment with different ear shapes and sizes
Experiment with different nose shapes and sizes

### Eyebrows
Eyebrows give expression
think about the direction they flex, a sad eyebrow sinks toward the eye, a surprised one is curved away.  Think about the musculature
Experiment with eyebrows.  They do a lot.

### Baby
Very round
Big forehead, eyes very low
little ears
little nose
curly que hair to really sell it
eyes spaced farther apart are cuter (to a point)
the bigger the forehead the harder the sell, think upside down egg shape.  Don't turn it into Brainiac though.


### Kid
eyes centered vertically or slightly low
ears small but bigger than baby
eye spacing can do a lot of work here
nose small but bigger than baby
pigtails or high ponytail can sell female characters

### Teen
ears normal size (or possibly even big to sell)
more tall than wide shape vs kid, lanky
bigger nose vs kid but not emphasized, adult nose
Messy hair to sell
Grumpy expression to sell
Acne to sell
lipstick to sell female character
high ponytail to sell female character

### Young Adult

### Middle Age
Eyes less far apart
Bags under eyes
Balding or receding hairline to sell a male character
Ears and nose grow with age

### Elderly
Eyes less far apart
Bags under eyes
Ears and nose much bigger (emphasized commonly with male characters, nose may obscure mouth and take up half the face, ears may be 60% of the height of the head)
Glasses to sell
Bald to sell male character
Broccoli hair to sell female character


## Part 3: Bodies
