 From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

**Modern Library's 100 Best Novels** is a 1998 list of the best English-language novels published during the 20th century,[a](a.md)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Library_100_Best_Novels#cite_note-1) as selected by [Modern Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Library "Modern Library") from among 400 novels published by [Random House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_House "Random House"), which owns Modern Library.[1](1.md)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Library_100_Best_Novels#cite_note-2) The purpose of the list was to "bring the Modern Library to public attention" and stimulate sales of its books.[2](2.md)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Library_100_Best_Novels#cite_note-Lewis-3) A separate [Modern Library 100 Best Nonfiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Library_100_Best_Nonfiction "Modern Library 100 Best Nonfiction") list of the 100 best non-fiction books of the 20th century was created the same year.

## Editors' list[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modern_Library_100_Best_Novels&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Editors' list")]

During early 1998, the Modern Library polled its editorial board to find their opinions of the best 100 novels. The board of review consisted of [Daniel J. Boorstin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_J._Boorstin "Daniel J. Boorstin"), [A. S. Byatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._S._Byatt "A. S. Byatt"), [Christopher Cerf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Cerf_(musician_and_television_producer) "Christopher Cerf (musician and television producer)"), [Shelby Foote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_Foote "Shelby Foote"), [Vartan Gregorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vartan_Gregorian "Vartan Gregorian"), [Edmund Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Morris_(writer) "Edmund Morris (writer)"), [John Richardson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Richardson_(art_historian) "John Richardson (art historian)"), [Arthur Schlesinger Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schlesinger_Jr. "Arthur Schlesinger Jr."), [William Styron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Styron "William Styron") and [Gore Vidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gore_Vidal "Gore Vidal"). All but Gregorian were published by Random House or an affiliate.[2](2.md)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Library_100_Best_Novels#cite_note-Lewis-3)

_[Ulysses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_(novel) "Ulysses (novel)")_ by [James Joyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce "James Joyce") topped the list, followed by [F. Scott Fitzgerald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._Scott_Fitzgerald "F. Scott Fitzgerald")'s _[The Great Gatsby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby "The Great Gatsby")_ and Joyce's _[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Portrait_of_the_Artist_as_a_Young_Man "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man")_. The most recent novel in the list is [William Kennedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kennedy_(author) "William Kennedy (author)")'s _[Ironweed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironweed_(novel) "Ironweed (novel)")_, published in 1983; the oldest is _[The Way of All Flesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_of_All_Flesh "The Way of All Flesh")_ by [Samuel Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Butler_(novelist) "Samuel Butler (novelist)"), which was written between 1873 and 1884, but not published until 1902. [Joseph Conrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Conrad "Joseph Conrad")'s _[Heart of Darkness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Darkness "Heart of Darkness")_ was technically first published as a three-part serial in 1899; however, it was not published as a novel in a single volume until 1902, making it eligible for the list. Conrad has four novels on the list, the most of any author. [William Faulkner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Faulkner "William Faulkner"), [E. M. Forster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._M._Forster "E. M. Forster"), [Henry James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_James "Henry James"), James Joyce, [D. H. Lawrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._H._Lawrence "D. H. Lawrence"), and [Evelyn Waugh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Waugh "Evelyn Waugh") each have three novels. There are ten other authors with two novels.

The following table shows the top ten novels from the editors' list:[3](3.md)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Library_100_Best_Novels#cite_note-MLList-4)

## Notes[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modern_Library_100_Best_Novels&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Notes")]

1.  **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Library_100_Best_Novels#cite_ref-1 "Jump up")** [Arthur Koestler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Koestler "Arthur Koestler")'s _[Darkness at Noon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkness_at_Noon "Darkness at Noon")_ was originally written in German, but since the original German text was lost at the time this list was published, and German versions, published with the title _Sonnenfinsternis_ (literally "[solar eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse "Solar eclipse")") were back-translations from English, it was reasonable to consider the English version the canonical contemporary text. The German manuscript was found in 2015, published in German in 2018, and published in English translation in 2019.
