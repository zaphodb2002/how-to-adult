	- 2023-04-07 This ended up not really being an issue.  Cancelling

- [-] New Mission: Include added date in tasks ⏫ ➕ 2023-03-03 
	- Turns out this was resolved in 2.0.
	- it would be nice if Obsidian Tasks would also use the added emoji that dataview uses. 
	- I'm currently using the start date and it would be nice to differentiate between when I thought of it and when I actually started working on it
	- If I chose to remove Tasks, be aware that you potentially lose two things:
		- Urgency calculations, which are awesome
		- the easy sorting
		- However, templater could autopopulate and could add metadata
	- or maybe even if it could not fucking block me from using Emoji  Shortcodes while its prompt is up

	- issue here is that I could create a quest, but if I don't also make a task immediately the quest tracker will not have anything to show.  Despite it's name, it tracks tasks, not quests.  
		- this is another argument for rewriting it with DataView
	- for now, I have just made a task at the top of the quest Handle the MiddleClick Paste Issue for creating the first mission.
