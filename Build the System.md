- [-] New Mission: Include added date in tasks ⏫ ➕ 2023-03-03 
	- Turns out this was resolved in 2.0.
	- it would be nice if Obsidian Tasks would also use the added emoji that dataview uses. 
	- I'm currently using the start date and it would be nice to differentiate between when I thought of it and when I actually started working on it
	- If I chose to remove Tasks, be aware that you potentially lose two things:
		- Urgency calculations, which are awesome
		- the easy sorting
		- However, templater could autopopulate and could add metadata
	- or maybe even if it could not fucking block me from using Emoji  Shortcodes while its prompt is up
