# Structure
## [Folders](Folders.md)
Files gotta live somewhere.  Represents hierarchical structure.  These correspond to the [Aspects](Aspects.md).
- This uses the Johnny.Decimal system for the most part but I'm building slowly and only making new folders as necessary.

## [Links](Links.md)
Shows the direct relationships between notes.
- 
## [Tags](Tags.md)
Tags, I think, will be used to denote type and status, at least for now.  Unfortunately [Obsidian Tasks](./Obsidian%20Tasks.md) cannot currently do metadata queries so we cannot use that for task lists.  I believe this is changing soon though.
They may also be used for other things later, I liked the idea of using them as more loose concepts to join notes by skill required or maybe even the emotion attached to them.
