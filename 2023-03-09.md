- 2023-03-10 16:37 edit from the FuUuTuRe!  Chips ran away!  He was gone all day!  Cosmo and he had been digging under the fence over by the west side of the property, on the backside of the forest.  I came outside to get them and they did not come.  I began to panic and yelled louder.  Cosmo came around the corner, in my neighbor's yard (behind, used to be Nikki now I dunno) and came right to me.  but no Chips!  I panicked and ripped apart the fence to get Cosmo back in, then put Cosmo inside and went around the neighborhood looking for him.  this was maybe noon or 1300.  I started on foot and went around talking to anyone I could find.  Got into my car, Steph called, I got her involved.  Jon also helped.  We scoured the neighborhood for hours.  As the sun went down and temperature dropped, I began to despair.  My boy was gone.  I had let him get lost.  He was out there all alone, in the cold and the dark, and he didn't know how to get home.  Coyotes eat things bigger than him.  Hell, hawks or motherfucking bald eagles will pick up Chips-sized rodents.  While we were out looking we literally had to stop for a ?Red-Tailed Hawk? some big ass bird with a fucking squirrel corpse in its clutches.  Steph had to get out of the car and shoo it away.  Beastly thing.  It was attacked by crows as it left too, shit's wild out here.  Anyway I came home despondent and as the sun finally set, I refused to come in.  My boy was outside in the cold so I was gonna be too.  If he came home I'd be there to find him.  and lo and behold, I'm sitting on the porch, balling my eyes out and freezing my ass off, and hear a whine coming from where I know they got out through the fence.  I stand up and shout for him, and I hear one solitary yap and more whining.  I bolt upstairs for my flashlight and back down and out to the far corner of the property.  There he is, little shit.  He's on the farthest possible place to be without jumping like 3 fences.  So I call steph blubbering that I got him I found him.  She comes out and Chips is just crying his brains out now.  Steph tries to lift him over by putting her tiny little hands through the fence but can't get him good enough.  I give her the flashlight and fucking sprint out and around the block, my fat ass hauling as fast as itll go.  I'm all high on adrenaline at this point so I'm not feeling anything at the moment.  To get to where Chips is being held by steph through the fence, I have to go through a ... let's call him shady neighbor's front yard.  not anything fenced in, just his driveway.  But I make a lot of noise and have a bright as fuck flashlight so I'm not being sneaky I'm clearly talking to a dog.  Neighbor comes out to his screen door, white guy, maybe late 60s, big grey handlebar mustache, wearing nothing but his tighty-whities and socks, holding a ***GUN***.  Handgun of some sort, didn't get a good look.  He says "You got a reason for being out here" and I'm holding a dog above my head and crying and shouting "My dog jumped the fence, my dog jumped the fence, sorry man" and basically running away.  He didn't point it at me or anything and I was on his property at night but it was like 1830 or so, it had JUST got dark.  Anyway I was already jacked on adrenaline and overjoyed that he came home and I was still sort of processing what had just happened by the time I got back to Steph, I was working it out as I was saying it, gasping for air after running so much - "Man... In his underpants... had a gun."  "What?"  "Man in his underpants had a gun!"
- Long story short is that Chips is home safe and sound and I did not get shot, did not die of a heart attack from running for 4 minutes straight (I gotta get back in shape), AND also did not shit myself from fear when confronted with a man with a gun, so that's something.
