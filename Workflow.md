# Intake
1. Create Daily Note
	- Uses [Daily Note Template.md](Daily%20Note%20Template.md)
2. Take notes and create tasks throughout the day in the daily note
	- Things to Do and Things that Happened sections are provided
3. Any tasks remaining uncompleted are rolled over from the previous day
4. See Rules For Task Entry
# Act
- The Quest Tracker will display the most urgent task only.  Go do it.
- The Routine Tracker will display the most urgent routine task.  Go do it.
# Process
## Daily
- Daily Note:
		1. Move task to appropriate top level Campaign Note
- Campaign Note:
		1. If the task can be completed now, do it.
		1. if not, move it to the appropriate aspect.
			1. If no appropriate aspect exists, consider creating one (you only get 10 per campaign)
- Aspect Note:
	1. At this point, tasks need to become one of the following:
		- A Campaign or Aspect all its own.  See [Rules for Campaigns and Aspects](Rules%20for%20Campaigns%20and%20Aspects.md)
		- A Quest
			- Is this a major accomplishment? Will it take many complex tasks over time to complete?  It's probably a Quest. [Rules for Quests and Missions](Rules%20for%20Quests%20and%20Missions.md)
		- A Mission for a Quest
			- Is it something with multiple steps, but in and of itself isn't necessarily a major life accomplishment?  Will it help you achieve an already existing quest?  Sounds like a Mission.
		- A task for a Mission
			- Does this fit with any current missions?  Put it there if so.
		- A Record
			- Do you need to track or log lots of similar things, like music albums you've listened to or movies you've seen and rating them?  How about tracking each plant in your garden year after year?  Records are for you.
		- A Knowledge
			- Anything you need to reference or remember but don't need to act on.  
	2. If it doesn't fit in any of these categories, either rethink it or throw it away.  It will not serve you.
