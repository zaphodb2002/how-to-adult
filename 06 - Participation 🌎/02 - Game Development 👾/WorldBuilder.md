# Summary
 WorldBuilder is a collaborative world-building tool designed to allow non-technical people like artists and writers to help create game worlds.

# Features
## Networked Multiplayer
WorldBuilder allows for multiple users to be working at the same time on the same map.

## Voxel-Based Terrain
WorldBuilder Terrain works with both cube-based and smooth voxels, and is fully modifiable by users in real time.

## Heightmap Imports
WorldBuilder can import greyscale heightmaps, csv data, or create terrain via random noise.

## Automatic Engine Rules
WorldBuilder is designed to make game worlds, so it stays true to the game's engine rules.
- Plants can only grow in valid places
- Texture changes based on slope angle
- Structures conform to game rules
- Biome rules applied
- Water flow rules applied
- Time of day and seasons

## Designer View System
Add notes, test objects and other hidden things for others or your future self in Designer View, which can be accessed in the game engine as well.
