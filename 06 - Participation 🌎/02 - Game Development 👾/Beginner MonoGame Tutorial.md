# Summary
I have not found a lot of basic resources for MonoGame, and even less with Nez. Since this is the route we're going down for [Game Development](Game%20Development.md), at least for now, we'll start with a tutorial about how to build a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game, and juice it up.

RECORD EVERYTHING YOU DO SO YOU CAN REFERENCE LATER!

# Tasks
- [ ] New Quest: Upgrade this mission into a minor quest #bureaucracy ü•Ñ+1 ‚è´ ‚ûï 2023-03-31
- [ ] Clean up the repo
- [ ] Write out the tutorial
- [ ] publish the tutorial on github
- [ ] make videos (how long should these be?)
- [ ] Publish videos once a week

# Notes
- How long should each video be?
	- 30 minutes is probably a sweet spot, no longer than 45.
- How long should it take a viewer to go through these videos at twice a week?
	- I'd like to get it into 8 videos. This would imply 4 weeks of work for the user, at twice a week. I think that can be done.
