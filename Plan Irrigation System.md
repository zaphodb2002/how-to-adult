# Tasks
- [ ] Create the first task for this mission #bureaucracy 🥄+1 ⏫ ➕2023-04-17 🛫 2023-07-07 
# Notes
- Can I do like a flood irrigation on a timer? Keep it simple, stupid.
- I like the blumats in theory but so far in practice they have not been effective.  They either require too much fiddling or aren't durable enough 
- They're also super expensive and you couldn't make them yourself if you needed to.  [Self Sufficiency](./07%20-%20Self%20Sufficiency.md) would like a word here.
