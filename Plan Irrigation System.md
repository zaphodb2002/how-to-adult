# Notes
[Irrigation System](./Irrigation%20System.md)
- Can I do like a flood irrigation on a timer? Keep it simple, stupid.
- I like the blumats in theory but so far in practice they have not been effective.  They either require too much fiddling or aren't durable enough 
- They're also super expensive and you couldn't make them yourself if you needed to.  [Self Sufficiency](07%20-%20Self%20Sufficiency.md) would like a word here.
