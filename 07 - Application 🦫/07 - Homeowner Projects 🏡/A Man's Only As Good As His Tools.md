# Things to Do
- [ ] Create the first mission for this quest ðŸ¥„1 ðŸ†™+1 âž• 2023-03-18


# Summary
campaign:: [07 - Self Sufficiency](07%20-%20Self%20Sufficiency.md)
aspect:: [07 - Tools](07%20-%20Tools.md)

## Complete Criteria:
1. Own a glorious toolbox, something you really love. There are some cool ones out there.
2. Treat your tools like you would treat a book. Would you fucking leave a plastic bucket full of books in the damn rain for 6 months? No, not even at your most depressed. Tools, like books, will return to you the effort you put into them tenfold, or a hundredfold, depending on the quality of the tool and the aptitude of the craftsman. 
3. Be that guy who has a foam cutout or whatever for each individual tool. Put things away where they belong. There's a Quest somewhere about this as a more general value to internalize: [Mise en Place](../../02-%20Protection%20%F0%9F%9B%A1/01%20-%20Maintenance%20%F0%9F%A7%B9/Mise%20en%20Place.md) I cleverly named it. Linkity.

## Why is this important?:
A great craftsman will produce great crafts regardless of tool *quality*, but even a great quality tool allowed to rust is useless to everyone. Take care of your shit better, yo.
