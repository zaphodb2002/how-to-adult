# Things to Do
- [ ] Create the first mission for this quest ðŸ¥„1 ðŸ†™+1 âž• 2023-03-31

# Summary
campaign:: [00 - Life Management System](../00%20-%20Life%20Management%20System.md)
aspect:: [02 - Tools](./02%20-%20Tools.md)
## Complete Criteria:
1. Documentation exists for all user scripts in use
2. Documentation shows where in the system it is used

## Why is this important?:
Eventually I will forget what these do, and it may be useful for someone else later. Never a bad idea to document.

# Missions
