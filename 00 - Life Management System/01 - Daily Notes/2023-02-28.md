- Created [Set Up Obsidian](Set%20Up%20Obsidian.md) quest
- Created [Use The System](Use%20The%20System.md) quest
- Had an issue where I lost this note.  Not sure what happened but I was mucking about in the settings for [[QuickAdd]].  Had to recreate.  This really needs to not happen.
- Took an [edible](Cannabis Edibles.md) at ~15:45 and it's 17:08 now.  1 tsp cannabutter (estimated 75mg) in coffee.  Haven't eaten much today but what I did eat was fatty.

- Rejiggering [[Quest Tracker]] and [[Campaigns]] a bunch.  
	- The campaigns will hopefully grow organically, should really only make a new folder when I need it.
	- Quest Tracker needs a lot of work.  there big issue is formatting, I have all the data I need.
