# Things to Do
- [x] Create the first mission for this quest ➕ 2023-04-04 ✅ 2023-04-04
- [ ] New Mission: Research how others are using Tags #bureaucracy 🥄+1 ⏫ ➕ 2023-04-04

# Summary
campaign:: [00 - Life Management System](../00%20-%20Life%20Management%20System.md)
aspect:: [03 - Workflow](./03%20-%20Workflow.md)

## Complete Criteria:
1. 

## Why is this important?:
Tags allow for more flexible linking. There are times when a quest or mission crosses over into a different aspect or even campaign, those links could be represented with tagging.

Also, tasks can be tagged. This may be the best use of tags for now, because [Obsidian Tasks](../02%20-%20Tools/Obsidian%20Tasks.md) can use those
