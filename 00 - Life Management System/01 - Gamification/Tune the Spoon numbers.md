- [x] Come up with some rules #design #LMS 🥄5 🆙+5 ➕ 2023-05-11 ⏳ 2023-05-13 ✅ 2023-05-17
- [x] Check back in on this in June #testing #LMS 🥄1 🆙+1 ⏫ ➕ 2023-05-11 ⏳ 2023-06-01 ✅ 2023-06-01
# Notes
Gonna mess with the numbers to get it to feel good. Here are the general rules I've settled on:

🥄1 ~= 5 minutes
Spoon Cap is 90
minimum effort for a day is 36 (3 hours)
maximum effort is 90 (7.5 hours)
Roll over half (rounded down) at the end of the day

Idea: tags modify spoons with specific values
