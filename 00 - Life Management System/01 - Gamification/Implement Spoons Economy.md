# Things to Do


# Summary
campaign:: [00 - Life Management System](../00%20-%20Life%20Management%20System.md)
aspect:: [01 - Gamification](./01%20-%20Gamification.md)
completed:: [2023-06-01](../09%20-%20Daily%20Notes/2023-06-01.md)

## Complete Criteria:
1. Spoon counter is visible on screen
2. All tasks cost an amount of spoons as designated by metadata
3. Task spoon cost represents how much effort will be required.
4. Spoons can be added and taken away
5. All habits have spoon values as designated by metadata
6. Habit spoon value represents how good the habit makes me feel.

## Why is this important?:
The idea here is to represent the energy and willingness I have to do work. If I run out of spoons, it is a cue to go do something from the habits, which will be things like going outside, going for a walk, playing a video game, watching a tv show, etc.
