# Journal Entry

It's been a day, and it's not even 1600 yet. This morning I got in a fight with [Mom](../../03%20-%20Belonging%20%F0%9F%91%AA/01%20-%20The%20Clan/Tara%20Lindhardt.md) on the phone. She had called to see what we were doing for Mother's Day and I made the mistake of mentioning that I hadn't been on Adderall and am having withdrawals. She immediately starts in on how I need to make sure I get prescribed a different drug because this one is always out of stock. Yes, Mother, I know it's a problem. Yes I have looked at other medications. Yes I changed my Adderall to the instant instead of extended because that was more available at the time. No that doesn't mean it's magically always available. Yes I am aware other ADHD drugs are not scheduled. Yes I know Straterra is one, I'm on it, as I've said many times. It's like there's a script she goes off of. Always the same questions we've been over. I am acutely aware of the answers to each of them. And then she gets mad at me for being frustrated.

It's not terribly productive to dwell on being mad at Mom for being overbearing. She's not attacking me, she's misguidedly trying to help. More importantly, she's not going to change. She also was asking about my availability to look at her car that they're getting. I was snippy about it. I don't like the car, and I'm a little frustrated that I was only sort of listened to. I dunno, Mom seems totally all over the place with the car. First it needs to be cheap, then she's looking at $16k worth of car; she wants it to be fun to drive and sporty, then it needs to be fuel efficient, but now it's maybe the most boring car possible outside of maybe a minivan AND it's a bigger vehicle so worse mileage. The parents will do what they're gonna do, I suppose, but it doesn't seem very well thought out. Not much I can help them with if they don't know what they want.

Ultimately the fate of Mother's Day is that we're not doing it because I've been sick. Also I'm probably pretty poor company.

My new 3D printer shit the bed today too. Have I even logged that I bought this thing? It was incredibly useful for the couple of days it worked until it literally ruined itself by filling the entire extruder with plastic. I sent an email to Sovol, we'll see what they do. In the meantime I'm trying to get the plastic off this thing. I managed to burn the absolute shit out my right middle finger. It's all blistered up now.

I have not been successful so far in fixing the extruder. For sure I think the temp sensor at least is kaput, and the silicone sock is super fucked up so we'll need to replace that sooner rather than later. I know for sure I broke off a plastic piece in the extruder somewhere, which was my own dumbass mistake and probably gonna end up costing me a bunch of money. I am not happy about it, and generally pretty unhappy today.

I have spent a bunch of time today learning the [Zylann's Godot Voxel Module](../../06%20-%20Participation%20%F0%9F%8C%8E/02%20-%20Game%20Development%20%F0%9F%91%BE/Zylann's%20Godot%20Voxel%20Module.md) stuff which has been a lot of fun. The documentation on this thing is excellent and I really think I'll be able to use this well. I am particularly interested in the instancing it can do as well for things like rocks and plants.
