I need to do these more often. I've been struggling the last few days. How long ago was it that I started to feel the slide into [Depression](Depression.md)? Let's go check.

Shit, that was [2023-04-13](./2023-04-13.md), 21 days ago. As of maybe Monday I've been feeling a lot better. How are we going to mark this point in the swing? I'm not [Manic](Manic.md) just yet, I don't think. Let's call it [Emotional Equilibrium](Emotional%20Equilibrium.md). Feeling [Energetic](Energetic.md) and in good humor. That's coming off a few really rough weeks though. Let's recap the last few weeks for retrospection:

3 weeks was two vet appointments, one for [Bobbaloo](Bobbaloo.md) and one for [Cosmo](../../03%20-%20Belonging%20%F0%9F%91%AA/00%20-%20The%20Pack%20%F0%9F%90%95/Cosmo.md) and [Ice Cream](../../03%20-%20Belonging%20%F0%9F%91%AA/00%20-%20The%20Pack%20%F0%9F%90%95/Ice%20Cream.md), and that weekend we went to Temecula to have sushi with [Jon Hamilton](../../03%20-%20Belonging%20%F0%9F%91%AA/01%20-%20The%20Clan/Jon%20Hamilton.md) and [Aunt Robin](../../03%20-%20Belonging%20%F0%9F%91%AA/01%20-%20The%20Clan/Robin%20Hamilton.md) which was fun but I noted that I was feeling low and tired that day.

2 weeks ago was buying [Steph's Subaru Crosstrek](Steph's%20Subaru%20Crosstrek.md), which was a fucking exhausting ordeal.

Last week was [Disneyland](Disneyland.md). Fun, but exhausting. Also I had three fucking edibles that day.

Anyway, I'm feeling better mentally lately. Physically, not so much. I'm ether sick with a head cold or I'm having hardcore allergies. Both are possible, as it seems [Steph](../../03%20-%20Belonging%20%F0%9F%91%AA/01%20-%20The%20Clan/Stephanie%20Fear.md) and [Felix](Felix.md) are feeling similarly and they don't typically have allergies, but also everything is fucking covered in pollen. I'm managing it with some OTC meds but it's a pain in the ass. Hopefully it is just a cold and passes quickly.

I'm also getting back into [Microscope](Microscope.md). I think it would be a great way to do [Worldbuilding](Worldbuilding.md), and I think it'll be fun. I want to watch a couple of plays on YouTube though before I try to run a game, so I have a decent feel for the game. I should look up other worldbuilding games, I know there's the one with artifacts and stuff, and Kingdom which is from the same dev as Microscope is similar. Have to look through what I've got. I wonder if I could teach a chatbot to play.
