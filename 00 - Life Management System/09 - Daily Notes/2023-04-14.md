## Journal
Had to take [My Ford Focus RS](My%20Ford%20Focus%20RS.md) down to [Mom](../../03%20-%20Belonging%20%F0%9F%91%AA/01%20-%20The%20Clan/Tara%20Lindhardt.md) this morning, her car's transmission went out and she's without a car for a bit. Not a big deal, I don't need to go anywhere most of the time and if I do, usually it's with [Steph](../../03%20-%20Belonging%20%F0%9F%91%AA/01%20-%20The%20Clan/Stephanie%20Fear.md) and she can drive. Killed a lot of the day though. Also it was cloudy and cold this morning, unpleasant. It has warmed up quite a bit though, I have been able to open the windows and get some fresh air and do a little bit of work outside. The [Order Garden](Order%20Garden.md) is coming a long, albeit a lot slower than expected. It's exhausting to move all that dirt and I stupidly put the opening at the hardest place to get to from the drop off area. I really should build a gate on the other side as well, but I haven't gotten to the first gate yet. Weather has just not been good and I've been [Tired](Tired.md). Hopefully we can get at the very least all the rows fertilized and planted before the [2023-04-30](./2023-04-30.md) deadline that I've set for [Early Spring](Early%20Spring.md).

I'm feeling a bit better today than yesterday, but I noticed that I'm still a bit [Cranky](Cranky.md) and Steph was seeming rather angry and unhappy this morning, not the best vibes. I'm not sure if she's just generally not happy or specifically not happy because I didn't want to spend my day over there, but I needed some time to myself and also was hoping to get some things done.

I also had a bit of an emotional surge this morning, I was driving down the 78 just out of [Julian](../../01%20-%20Subsistence%20%F0%9F%92%97/08%20-%20Location%20%F0%9F%A7%AD/Julian,%20CA.md) and had some thought about wanting to die peacefully, which spun out in my imagination to how I might handle the decision to end my own life, when the time comes. I'm not afraid of dying and am wholeheartedly in support of assisted suicide, but the idea of trying to tell my loved ones that it's time to go hit me real hard. I was hit with a sudden wave of [Grief](Grief.md) and [Sadness](Sadness.md) and teared up a bit. I got myself under control fairly quickly, though. That keeps happening lately. Getting a little choked up now. 

Working on the [Routines](../03%20-%20Workflow/Routines.md) quite a bit. The [Spoon Counter](../02%20-%20Tools/Spoon%20Counter.md) system is also up and running now, although it's mostly just been experimental. This really needs a [Feature Design](Feature%20Design.md).  It's going to have to be automated, but that doesn't seem terribly difficult. It seems to be doing its job. I can do things, then when I run out of spoons, I can switch over to doing Routine stuff, which gives back spoons. I've also set up a minimum and maximum effort percentage, which helps to keep my amount of work each day less spiky. And there's a definite cutoff as to what's "enough" and what's "too much" which I seem to have issues with. I really need to be tracking these percentages somewhere. The effort numbers may change over time so we'll need to log these percentages (or I guess maybe just whatever the min and max effort targets are each day) so this can be analysed over time.
