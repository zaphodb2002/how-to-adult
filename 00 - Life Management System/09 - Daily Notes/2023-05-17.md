# Journal Entry

Got my [Adderall](Adderall.md) on Monday and I'm feeling much better now. Missed a bunch of days and was all out of sorts. I'm back now though and feeling [Energetic](Energetic.md). I do feel just a bit [Manic](Manic.md) the last few days as well. I've spent a bunch of money on [ Fishkeeping](06%20-%20Fishkeeping.md) stuff and seem to be diving back into that. Spent a bunch of time learning about South Asian plants and fish. Link I'm going to start trying to limit each tank to a specific region.

Got a call from Garrett Wiser today about a potential contract job. Sounds like we'd be doing a migration/conversion for a hospital running Practice Partner. He's saying they're budgeting like $12k so assuming we can get it done in less than a month or so that's pretty decent money. He'll hopefully be sending me some details soon.
