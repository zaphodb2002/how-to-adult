## Things to Do


## Things I Did
- Created [Set Up Obsidian.md](../02%20-%20Tools/Set%20Up%20Obsidian.md) quest
- Created [Use The System.md](../03%20-%20Workflow/Use%20The%20System.md) quest
- Had an issue where I lost this note. Not sure what happened but I was mucking about in the settings for [Quickadd](Quickadd.md). Had to recreate. This really needs to not happen.
- Took an [edible](../../04%20-%20Recreation%20%F0%9F%8E%8A/01%20-%20Psychonautics%20%F0%9F%A7%A0/Cannabis%20Edibles.md) at ~15:45 and it's 17:08 now. 1 tsp cannabutter (estimated 75mg) in coffee. Haven't eaten much today but what I did eat was fatty.
- Rejiggering [Quest Tracker](../02%20-%20Tools/Quest%20Tracker.md) and [Campaigns](Campaigns.md) a bunch. 
	- The campaigns will hopefully grow organically, should really only make a new folder when I need it.
	- Quest Tracker needs a lot of work. the big issue is formatting, I have all the data I need. 
- Set up [Obsidian Sync](Obsidian%20Sync.md) so I can use this thing on my phone. $96 a year but I can cut some stuff to offset.
- Implemented a [Scratch Pad](../02%20-%20Tools/Scratch%20Pad.md) to use for code stuff like math and whatever
- got this dumb thing synced to my phone
