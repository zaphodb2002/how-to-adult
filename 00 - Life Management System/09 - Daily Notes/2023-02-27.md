## Things to Do


## Things I Did
- make a template for missions - [Set up templates](Set%20up%20templates.md.md)
- make a button that takes you to today's note - Done!
- [Obsidian Controls Reference](../02%20-%20Tools/Obsidian%20Controls%20Reference.md) - Implemented
- [Quest Tracker](../02%20-%20Tools/Quest%20Tracker.md) - Implemented
- Task list aggregate ([Obsidian Tasks](../02%20-%20Tools/Obsidian%20Tasks.md) syntax and options) - implemented but document
- [Campaigns](Campaigns.md) - Implemented
- [Quick Links](../02%20-%20Tools/Quick%20Links.md) - Implemented
- can I make it so that the links in the side panes open in the main tab area? - Solved! [Pin Notes To Sidebar](../02%20-%20Tools/Pin%20Notes%20To%20Sidebar.md)
- [Calendar plugin](Calendar%20plugin.md)? - installed, we'll see if we use it
- need to move due dates and priorities for tasks into metadata for dataview (duplicating work is bad, hacky scripts are also bad) - solved, they use the same emojis so we should be okay
