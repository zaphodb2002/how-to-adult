Source: https://www.justonecookbook.com/oyakodon/

### INGREDIENTS
-   ▢½ onion (4 oz, 113 g; peeled)
-   ▢10 oz boneless, skinless chicken thighs (**the weight of a thigh varies:** You need 1 or 2 thighs for 2 servings; if a thigh weighs 5-6 oz or 142-170 g, use two pieces; I used one 10-oz thigh for this recipe; for vegan/vegetarian, use plant-based meat substitute)
-   ▢1 Tbsp [sake](https://www.justonecookbook.com/sake/) (for marinating the chicken; sake helps to remove the chicken's gamey odor; you can also use Chinese rice wine or dry sherry, or otherwise, skip it)
-   ▢3-4 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) (1½ to 2 eggs per person is standard; at room temperature; for vegan/vegetarian, use egg substitute such as [JUST Egg](https://www.ju.st/))

#### For the Seasonings

-   ▢½ cup [dashi (Japanese soup stock; click to learn more)](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-make-dashi-jiru/) (using good, flavorful dashi is very important in this recipe; for vegan/vegetarian, make [Vegan Dashi](https://www.justonecookbook.com/vegan-shiitake-kombu-dashi/))
-   ▢2 Tbsp [soy sauce](https://www.justonecookbook.com/soy-sauce/)
-   ▢2 Tbsp [mirin](https://www.justonecookbook.com/mirin/)
-   ▢2 tsp sugar

#### For Serving

-   ▢2 servings cooked Japanese short-grain rice (1½ rice cooker cups (180 ml x 1.5 = 270 ml) yield roughly 2 donburi servings;
-   ▢4 sprigs [mitsuba (Japanese parsley)](https://www.justonecookbook.com/mitsuba/) (or green onion/scallion)
-   ▢[shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice)](https://www.justonecookbook.com/shichimi-togarashi/) (optional, if you like spicy)
-   ▢[Japanese sansho pepper](https://www.justonecookbook.com/sansho-pepper/) (optional, if you like pepper fragrance)

#### Before You Start

-   **This recipe includes both cooking methods—using a medium frying pan (about 10 inches/25 cm) and an oyakodon pan or small frying pan (8 inches/20 cm)**. Typically, oyakodon is made individually for each serving using an oyakodon pan, which lets you slide the cooked ingredients onto the rice bowl easily. See the separate cooking instructions below.
    
-   Gather all the ingredients. **Do not make more than two servings in a medium frying pan**. I explained a bit more in the blog post (under Oyakodon Cooking Tips). If you are making four servings, use two medium frying pans.
    

#### To Prepare the Seasonings

-   Combine the dashi, soy sauce, mirin, and sugar in a bowl or a liquid measuring cup and mix all together until the sugar is dissolved.
    

#### To Prepare the Ingredients

-   Slice the onion lengthwise, about ¼ inch (6 mm) wide.
    
-   Chop the mitsuba (or green onions) ½ inch (1.3 cm) wide.
    
-   Trim the extra bits of fat and connective tissue from the chicken with the knife.
    
-   Cut the chicken thigh along the grain into strips ¾ to 1 inch (2-2.5 cm) wide. Next, angle your knife back and diagonally (nearly parallel to the cutting board), and then slice the chicken strips against the grain into pieces about ¾ to 1 inch (2-2.5 cm) square. This [“_sogigiri_” cutting technique](https://www.justonecookbook.com/sogigiri/) gives the chicken pieces equal thickness and creates more surface area for fast cooking and better absorption of the flavors.
    
-   Transfer the chicken to a bowl or tray and sprinkle with the sake. Set aside for 5 minutes.
    
-   Crack the eggs into a bowl. Using a pair of chopsticks, lift the egg whites to "cut" them 5-6 times into a few smaller clumps. This will prevent the egg whites from falling into the frying pan all at once. Do not whisk or beat the eggs together. **Tip:** Aim for high color contrast between the white and yellow parts of the eggs in your finished dish.
    
-   While "cutting" the egg whites, you may have accidentally broken some of the egg yolks. That's okay. If the yolks haven't broken yet, you can poke them to gently break them, but do not blend the egg whites and yolks. The eggs should resemble a marble pattern.
    

#### To Cook the Oyakodon in a Medium Frying Pan

-   With the stove off, add the sliced onions to a medium frying pan (I use a well-seasoned [11” carbon steel pan](https://amzn.to/3RQW7vm)) in a single layer. Then, add the seasonings mixture. It should just cover the onions. If not, your frying pan is too big and you need to either increase the seasoning or use a smaller pan.
    
-   Turn on the heat to medium and bring it to a simmer. Once simmering, add the chicken on top of the onions.
    
-   Make sure the onions and chicken are evenly distributed. Once simmering again, lower the heat to medium low. Cook, uncovered, for **5 minutes** or until the chicken is no longer pink and the onions are tender. Halfway through, flip the chicken. **Tip:** Evaporation reduces the sauce and intensifies the flavor.
    
-   We will add the eggs in **two stages:** Two-thirds of the eggs first, then the remaining one-third later. Now, increase the heat to medium. With the cooking liquid simmering (small bubbles around the edges), drizzle two-thirds of the eggs in a circular pattern over the chicken and onions, **avoiding the edges** of the pan where the eggs can easily overcook. **Tip:** Only drizzle the eggs if the cooking liquid is simmering, as with [Egg Drop Soup](https://www.justonecookbook.com/kakitamajiru-japanese-egg-drop-soup/). Also, try to add **more egg whites** at this stage, as the whites take longer to cook than the yolks. Ideally, we want to keep the yolks soft and runny for the final presentation.
    
-   If the heat is too strong, lower the heat. If the egg is moving toward the edges of the pan, gently gather it toward the center where the heat is not as strong. Optionally, you can cover the pan if the egg whites are taking a long time to set.
    
-   When the eggs are still runny but just set, add the rest of the eggs to the center and around the edges of the pan. Add the _mitsuba_ (or green onion) on top and cook on medium low until the egg is done to your liking. Usually, oyakodon in Japan is served while the egg is almost set but still runny (raw eggs are safe to consume in Japan). **Tip:** For the remaining one-third of the egg, try to distribute **more egg yolks** so the oyakodon will have a bright yellow color on top. For a good presentation, you can add a beaten extra yolk at the end.
    
-   Serve steamed rice in individual serving bowls. Spoon the cooked chicken and egg mixture onto the steamed rice and drizzle the desired amount of pan sauce on top.
    

#### To Cook the Oyakodon in an Oyakodon Pan or a Small Frying Pan

-   **Cook the chicken and egg in two batches, one serving at a time. Make sure to divide the ingredients in half**. With the stove off, add half of the sliced onions to the pan in a single layer. Add half of the seasonings mixture (it should just cover the onions).
    
-   Turn on the heat to medium and bring it to a simmer. Once simmering, add half of the chicken on top of the onions.
    
-   Make sure the onions and chicken are evenly distributed. Once simmering, lower the heat to medium low. Cook, uncovered, for **4 minutes** or until the chicken is no longer pink and the onions are tender. Halfway through, flip the chicken. **Tip:** Evaporation helps to reduce the sauce and intensify the flavor.
    
-   We will add the eggs in **two stages:** Two-thirds of the eggs first, then the remaining one-third later. Now, increase the heat to medium. With the cooking liquid simmering (small bubbles around the edges), drizzle two-thirds of the eggs in a circular pattern over the chicken and onions, **avoiding the edges** of the pan where the eggs can easily overcook. **Tip:** Only add the eggs if the cooking liquid is simmering, as with [Egg Drop Soup](https://www.justonecookbook.com/kakitamajiru-japanese-egg-drop-soup/). Also, try to add more egg whites at this stage, as the whites take longer to cook than the yolks. Ideally, we want to keep the yolks soft and runny for the final presentation.
    
-   When the eggs are still runny but just set, add the rest of the eggs to the center and around the edges of the pan.

For a good presentation, you can add a beaten extra yolk at the end.
    
-   Serve steamed rice in an individual serving bowl. Slide the cooked chicken and egg mixture onto the steamed rice and drizzle the desired amount of pan sauce on top. Repeat Steps 1 to 6 with the remaining ingredients.
    

#### To Serve

-   Serve the Oyakodon with _shichimi togarashi_ and _sansho_ pepper on the side, if desired.
    

#### To Store

-   You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 days. To store in the freezer, do not add the eggs. You can add eggs after you reheat it in the pan.
