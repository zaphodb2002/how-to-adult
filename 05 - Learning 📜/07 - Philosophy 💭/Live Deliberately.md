# Things to Do
- [ ] This quest needs to be fleshed out. 🥄1 🆙+1 ⏫ ➕ 2023-03-13
	- One damn thing at a time
	- You're loading up the system with stuff. You need to take some time to work the tasks you have.
		- How can I prompt myself to stop input and work the existing missions? maybe a total task count limit or something? A calculated difficulty amount?
	- Also spend more time in the planning stages and don't skip to the end and just "wing it". Do it right the first time. Pay attention to what you're doing.
	- Really need to internalize a philosophy of patience, attention to detail, and simplicity. These are things I value, but I need to walk the walk.
