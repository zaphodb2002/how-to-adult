# Summary
 Linux is the OS kernel
 Created and overseen by Linus Torvalds
 Based on Unix, made by Bell AT&T and the first FOSS

# Your OS is your federal government
In order to understand the landscape of the different aspects of the computing world, let's make a comparison to politics.  You are an individual, and you gotta live somewhere.  There are effectively 4 major Operating System (OS) types.  We can think of these OS types as our major world governments.  These OS types can be compared to the following government types:
- Microsoft Windows - Capitalist Oligarchy (United States of America)
- Apple MacOS - Nationalist Dictatorship (Russian Federation)
- Linux - Anarchy (Unions, Punks, maybe Tribal Governments)
- Berkeley Software (BSD) - Communism (Cuba)

Let's dig into each.

### Microsoft Windows
- Capitalist Oligarchy (United States of America)
#### Pros
- Attracts the best and brightest, always has the newest and fanciest tech
- Has the most money by a wide margin, it's not even funny
- 90+% market share means it's the dominant culture worldwide (software is made primarily for Windows)
- Can interface with almost anything because it's the dominant "language" (like English is spoken everywhere for business, most people can use it and it'll run on pretty much anything)
- The "default" in computing, for better or worse
#### Cons
- People in charge monetize everything and are wildly out of touch with the regular people
- Ads!  SO MANY ADS!
- Nonstop spying
- Bloated and slow because trying to appeal to everyone with one solution (capitalism!)
- It includes everyone, and so most of those people are dumb as shit and very vocal about it
### Apple MacOS
- Nationalist Dictatorship / Cult of Personality (Russian Federation)
#### Pros
- Simple.  Hard and fast rules, lots of guardrails, if you stay in line and do as you're told, you'll do great.  No thinking required.
- Fast.  When you can only do a few things, you can do them better.
- Pretty.  It's hard to argue with their talent for design.  Much like Russia, macOS had some pretty cool designers and artists working for it (especially back in the day), despite being weird and insular.
- Inflated sense of self.  At least it's not Windows, right?
- Based on Unix.  Also like Russia stands atop the USSR, MacOS shares roots with Linux, and therefore the two have some crossover.
#### Cons
- Expensive. You pay out the ass to even exist in the environment.
- Insular. You must use their provided hardware, no other company is allowed to make computers using their OS.
- Limited.  Apple screens and approves every program that can run on their OS.  You must use what they tell you to use.
- Culty.  Apple is a lifestyle as well as a government.  It's enforced.
### Linux
- Anarchy (Unions, Punks, maybe Tribal Governments)
#### Pros
- Free.  Anyone can join with no restrictions and no cost.  Effectively no concept of borders.
- Open.  All of the actual source code is open to the public, for total transparency.  Further, contributions to the project are welcome and considered based on merit.  The only gatekeepers are the project managers, who are typically the "respected elders", i.e. the people who started the project.
- No private ownership.  Any component can be changed or sold or distributed for any reason with or without attribution.  So if a project manager is problematic or a project becomes unmaintained, the code can be "forked" (cloned, essentially) and a new project can be set up.
- Liberating.  Your only limit is your own skill and imagination.  Any way you want to interact with the computer (i.e., live your life), you can, and not only will you not be hassled, you'll probably find a community for it.
#### Cons
- Higher level of investment required.  Things can be difficult.  Freedom means responsibility.  You are given the freedom to hang yourself if you want.
- Analysis Paralysis.  Also known as distro-hopping in the community, lots of options means potentially switching a bunch until you find what you like, which can be a whole thing.
- Made by committee.  Not necessarily professionals, and not necessarily all working in perfect harmony.  Growth and progress can stagnate because of more human elements.
- Community can be elitist, but this is changing for the better lately.
- Compatibility with non-free software or hardware can be iffy

### BSD
- Communist (Cuba)
#### Pros
- Literally shares everything
- Theoretically the best idea
#### Cons
- Doesn't seem to work out practically
- Not very many of them

# Your Distro is your local government
## Community Driven
### Debian
#### Stable
#### Testing
#### Unstable ("Sid")
### Arch
#### Rolling Release
## Corporate Driven
### OpenSuSE
Backed by SuSE Enterprise
#### Leap
#### Tumbleweed
#### MicroOS
### Fedora
Backed by Red Hat Enterprise, owned by Oracle
# Major Distros in Detail
### Debian
#### Huge, Functional Anarchic Community
- The original community made distro
- Known for rock solid stability
- has a million options and derivatives
- Supports more hardware and software than any other distro
- Tons of online support from huge community
- Same problems that come with any large government:
	- bureaucracy means progress is slow
	- large, varied target demographics means bloat
	- not always the most, uh, cultured bunch
### Arch
#### Survivalist Supremacist Anarchic Community
- If Libertarians actually believed the things they said, they'd use Arch
- Barebones, provides nothing.  Expects you to know how to do everything.  Would not help you even if it could.
- Incredibly fast, lean, and bleeding edge.
- Unparalleled documentation, making it incredibly powerful for advanced users.
- The most assholes by a wide margin.
- I use Arch btw

### OpenSuSE
#### A German Corporation's Testing Grounds
- Backed by SUSE Software Solutions GmbH, a publicly owned company.
- Makes an Enterprise version of Linux for businesses that costs money.  They test things here in OpenSuSE, the free version, and once it's perfected they incorporate it into the paid SuSE Enterprise version
- Because it is managed by a company, it has stronger guidance in its development but fewer options
- Not quite as stable as Debian but faster and you can pay somebody to fix it for you
- The smallest of the four major distros in terms of community

### Fedora
#### Owned by Oracle now, and Oracle hates you
- Fedora is to Red Hat Enterprise Linux as OpenSuSE is to SuSE Enterprise.  They test in the free version then sell the results.
- Used to be owned by independently owned company Red Hat, now owned by evil megacorp Oracle.
- Recently closed a bunch of source and gave the finger to the community
- Pretty damn stable because Red Hat has been the de facto server Linux distro for 20+ years, but still probably not as stable as Debian.

# Derivative Distros are like Neighborhoods

## Debian-Based
### Ubuntu
https://ubuntu.com/
- Backed by Canonical, a privately owned company.
- The first distro to successfully appeal to more casual users and the third world education market
- Has a preference for an application delivery tool called Snap, because they make it.
- Even bigger and fatter than Debian, but even easier.
- HUGE community with lots of history.
- Flavors:
	- GNOME (Their custom version)
	- KDE Plasma (Called "KDE Neon")
	- XFCE (Called "Xubuntu")
	- Probably anything else too, there are a lot
#### Linux Mint
https://linuxmint.com/
- Based on Ubuntu, but there is a Debian Stable based version if you don't like Canonical's interference
- Snaps disabled by default if you go Ubuntu based
- Maintainer of Cinnamon DE
- Very easy to use, especially if you are familiar with Windows
- Probably more popular than Ubuntu nowadays.
#### Pop!\_OS
https://pop.system76.com/
- Based on Ubuntu, Snaps disabled by default.
- Backed by System76, a privately owned laptop manufacturer.  It is designed to support their hardware with deep integration but works on other hardware as well.
- Geared toward gamers and younger casual users.
- GNOME DE
#### VanillaOS
https://vanillaos.org/
- Based on Ubuntu but stripped down
- Can emulate any other distribution, including Arch, OpenSuSE, Fedora, anything.
- Immutable.  It's basically impossible to break this installation, but it's also much less customizable. Software is never truly installed but "sandboxed" and given virtual links to the things it needs.  This means it's incredibly safe and stable.
- New and weird.  Not much support for this sort of thing.
- GNOME by default but supports others.  Unlike most distros, can't run multiple DEs at once.
### MX Linux
https://mxlinux.org/
- maintained by antiX, a proudly anti-fascist dev collective
- uses "antiX magic", a tool to use the stable version of Debian with newer tech that base Debian doesn't support
- inspired by MEPIS, which is no longer maintained, but was considered to be one of the best and easiest desktop experiences of its time
- Currently the top distro on distrowatch.com
- Truly community driven, so the same issues with any bureaucratic project.  Development is slow and unfocused sometimes.
- Flavors:
	- XFCE (Their custom version)
	- KDE Plasma
	- Fluxbox

### EndlessOS
https://www.endlessos.org/os
- Backed by the Endless OS Foundation, a third world education non-profit
- Specifically designed for places that don't have familiarity with or resources for computing
- Immutable.  Like VanillaOS, incredibly safe and stable but new and a little limited.
- Flavors:
	- GNOME (Their custom version)


## Arch-Based
### EndeavourOS
https://endeavouros.com/
- A project to make Arch approachable.  GUI installer, ready to use out of the box.
- All the benefits of Arch with none of the command line
- still Arch, so probably not a good choice for stability
- Possibly my next distro
- Flavors:
	- XFCE (Their custom version)
	- Literally anything else, including their own custom WM called Worm
### Manjaro
https://manjaro.org/
- Another project to make Arch approachable.
- Has some fairly serious security issues and stability problems lately, unfortunately
- This is what you currently have, I just got away from them to go to base Arch.  Another reason we're looking at other distros.
- Flavors:
	- KDE Plasma
	- GNOME
	- XFCE
	- i3
	- Sway
	- bspwm
## OpenSuSE
### SuSE Enterprise
 - The paid version of OpenSuSE for servers
### Leap
- OpenSuSE with a Debian-Like release schedule.  Owned by SuSE.
### Tumbleweed
- OpenSuSE with an Arch-Like release schedule. Owned by SuSE.
### MicroOS
- Leap, but immutable.  Probably the most supported immutable OS.  Owned by SuSE.
### Regata
- A community fork of OpenSuSE with a focus on desktop and gaming needs.
### GeckoLinux
- A community fork of OpenSuSE with a focus on polish and out of box usability.
## Fedora
### Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
- The paid version of Fedora for servers
### Silverblue
- Immutable.  Owned by Red Hat.
### Nobara Project
- A gaming-centric distro maintained entirely by Glorious Eggroll, the patron saint of Linux gaming.
### CentOS
- Hilariously, a bug for bug copy of RHEL that's Free and Open Source.

## Distro is local government

### 
## DE/WM is your lifestyle
### GNOME
- The most common default DE
- Developed by the GNOME project, an international community project, though Red Hat is the largest contributor by far.
- Aims to be as easy to use and accessible as possible
- Most closely resembles macOS or a phone-like interface
### KDE Plasma
- The second most common default DE
- Developed by KDE, an international community project.  Companies do contribute but the vast majority is a volunteer effort.
- Aims to be a powerful, flexible, and rich user experience.
- Most closely resembles Windows
### Xfce
- The third most common default DE
- Based on the same tech as GNOME but not a fork
- Entirely community driven
- Aims to be fast, lightweight, and adhere to standards and good flexible code while still being easy to use and provide a good experience
- Traditional Windows-Like interface, but highly customizable
### Cinnamon
- A GNOME fork, meant to more closely resemble Windows as GNOME moved more toward a macOS style
- The flagship DE of Linux Mint, a Debian-based distro meant to ease users into Linux from Windows
- As you would expect, like Windows.
### Budgie
- An original DE not based on any other
- Aims to be simple, minimal, and elegant, with plugins or 3rd party components to extend functionality
- Developed by the "Buddies of Budgie"
- Kind of its own thing, not that common
### Deepin
- Based on the same tech as KDE Plasma but not a fork
- Incredibly beautiful
- Developed by the Chinese Government and has been in trouble for spyware before, but it is technically open, you can view all the source.
- Probably don't get this one
### Window Manager + Utils
Some people, usually power users, don't use a Desktop Environment at all.  They would prefer to build their own from custom components.  Window Managers are the part of a DE that draws to the screen, with the rest of the DE being tools like configuration menus, task bars, wallpaper and theme management, etc.  You could theoretically also cobble together whatever you want from custom parts, but like building a house on your own, it can be difficult and prone to issues.  Just for some exposure, here is a list of common WMs used for this purpose:
#### i3
A tiling WM meant to be used with the keyboard entirely.  You cannot move, resize, or minimize windows, instead, the system makes determinations on how best to lay out the windows for multitasking, based on configurable rules.  I use this.
#### Sway
i3 but with new tech.
#### bspwm
Similar to i3, behaves a little differently.
#### Fluxbox
A stacking WM that aims to be as light and simple as possible. Basically just a wallpaper and a right click menu for apps.
#### awesome
Tries to do everything i3 and Fluxbox can do, ultimately in my opinion does both worse than either.
