## Complete Criteria:
1. Buy no produce from the store for an entire year.

	2. Pickling
	3. Canning
	4. Freezing
	5. Making Stocks and Broths
	6. Butcher a chicken
	7. Baking Bread
	8. 
4. 

## Why is this important?:
I own the land, I should use it.  Supply chains have less effect on me.  Food legitimately tastes better.  If you can't feed yourself, how can you do anything else?
