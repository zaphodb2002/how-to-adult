# Notes
2023-03-08 09:44 - called pharmacy, they just haven't filled it, just been sitting there for like a week.  fuckin a.  Lady says she'll fill it now and should be ready today.

2023-03-05 10:39 - The website now says that the prescription was filled  on 2023-03-03 so we'll swing by on Tuesday to see if it's filled.

2023-03-03 - 
		- 12:18 They did not. I will call the doctor's office again.
		- 12:29 on hold forever but gonna wait.  need my damn meds.
		- talked to Annabelle (I think.  I repeated her name back to her but you know how the brain be doing) and she said she'd let [Dr. Wells](Dr.%20Wells.md) know to make the renewal.
		- Also got an approximate $118 for an office visit which isn't bad.
