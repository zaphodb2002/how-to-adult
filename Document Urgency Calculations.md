# Summary
Take a look at both the taskwarrior urgency but also the code of how it's implemented in [Obsidian Tasks](./Obsidian%20Tasks.md).  We may need to make PRs to implement some of this stuff.
# Tasks
- [x] Create the first task for this mission ⏫ ➕ 2023-03-24 ✅ 2023-03-24
- [ ] Do I need the concept of Blocking status for tasks? 🥄2 🔼 ➕ 2023-03-08
	- How would it reference the tasks that are blocked?
	- Could use frontmatter
- [ ] for the quest tracker urgency, need a waiting status (probably the scheduled date being in the future).  currently it doesn't suppress the urgency enough, all tasks should assume they are scheduled today if there is no scheduled date. the scheduled date isn't until tomorrow, I don't want to see the task until tomorrow unless there's literally nothing else to do 🥄2 🔼 ➕ 2023-03-08
